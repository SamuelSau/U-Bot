# U-Bot
This is a full stack web based application that allows you to practice with a AI-powered voice assistant that conducts a software engineering technical interview using natural language. The voice assistant primarily uses OpenAI's ChatGPT API, OpenAI's Whisper API, and ElevenLabs API to power the voice assistance feature. The web application is hosted on the cloud provider Google Cloud, with PostgreSQL database, and NextJS as the frontend, and Django as the backend framework.

## Getting Started
To use the voice assistant, simply navigate to the web application's URL in your browser. Once the page has loaded, you can press the start recording button to speak with the AI. Ensure that your microphone and speakers are unmuted. The AI will speak back to you when you finish when you stop recording and submit it.
