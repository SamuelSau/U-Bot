This is a web based application that allows you to practice with a AI-powered voice assistant that conducts a software engineering technical interview using natural language. The voice assistant primarily uses OpenAI's ChatGPT API, OpenAI's Whisper API, and ElevenLabs API to power the voice assistance feature. The web application is hosted on the cloud provider AWS RDS, with PostgreSQL as the DBMS and Django as the backend framework.

##Getting Started
To use the voice assistant, simply navigate to the web application's URL in your browser. Once the page has loaded, press the spacebar to activate the voice assistant. Ensure that your microphone and speakers are unmuted. The AI will speak back to you when you finish.

##Start the web application:
Navigate to <insertUrl> in your web browser to access the web application.

###Files and Directories
