If we encounter a right bracket, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, then the string is not balanced and we return False. Otherwise, we pop the most recent element from the stack which should be a left bracket corresponding to the current right bracket. \n\nFinally, we check if the stack is empty at the end of the iteration.
